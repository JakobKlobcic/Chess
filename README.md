1. **HTTP Server:** The functional chess application uses an HTTP server with JAVA Spark.

2. **Database Design:** A robust MySQL database.

3. **Web API:** A Web API is used to register login and start a game

4. **WebSocket:** The game runs on a websocket so it runs smoothly

The finalized project is a fully functional chess game application with multiple learning and mastering phases. The creation process involves developing different facets of the software, demonstrating the use of varying architectural concepts and technology. Initial phases include setting up the basic chess game and designing the server, followed by constructing an HTTP chess server through a Web API, then developing a persistent database for player data and authentication purposes. 

The advanced stages of the project involve the creation of a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the chess client and implementing gameplay that supports multiple players. Each phase of the project builds on the previous one and comes with starter code to assist in the process. Developers utilize Git for version control, ensuring code is regularly committed to GitHub to document progress. 

By the end of the project, users are able to play a complete game of chess with alternating turns, as shown in the chess-demo representation. The deliverables required for each phase ensure essential aspects of the code are tested and pass the set standards for each practical stage of development.
